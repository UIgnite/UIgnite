          UIgnite isn’t just a component library. It’s a design and development
          philosophy brought to life — one that values structure and freedom
          equally.

              UIgnite is proudly open-source. We’re building this not just for
              the community, but with it. Every decision, every line of code,
              and every improvement is shaped by real-world needs and real
              developer feedback. This isn’t just our library — it’s yours too.

              Each component is designed to be extended, styled, and combined
              however you like — without friction. Build what you want, how you
              want it.

          Why Another UI Component Library?

          Because we wanted to learn by building — not just using. Because every
          time we started a new project, the same question echoed:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “What’s the simplest, cleanest, most flexible way to build this?”
        </blockquote>
        <h4 className=" mt-2">
          So instead of reaching for yet another bloated abstraction, we started
          from scratch — with a few clear rules:

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <div>
            <li className="text-gray-300">
              No unnecessary dependencies. Just what you need, nothing more.

          <div>
            <li className="text-gray-300">
              No hidden logic. You see what you get, and you control the rest.

          <div>
            <li className="text-gray-300">
              No buzzwords or jargon. Just straightforward, reusable,
              developer-first code.

        </ul>

          What Makes UIgnite Different
        </h1>

        <h4 className="mt-2 mb-2">
          Plenty of great UI libraries exist, but UIgnite takes a fresh
          approach:

              UIgnite adapts to your design language — minimalist, bold,

              We believe in building with small, flexible pieces that scale

          Use it, tweak it, break it, rebuild it. <br />
          Make it your own. Because great UI doesn’t come from black boxes — it
          comes from tools that bend to your vision, not the other way around.
